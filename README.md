# What's here
Scripts for running Bespokefit on host systems and results.

Host to do list:
[] GDCC hosts from SAMPL7 and SAMPL8, e.g. https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL7/tree/master/host_guest/GDCC_and_guests (or https://github.com/samplchallenges/sampl8)
  - OA *[WIP]*
  - exo OA *[TO DO]*
[] Cyclodextrins; set of modified cyclodextrin derivatives: https://github.com/samplchallenges/SAMPL7/tree/master/host_guest/cyclodextrin_derivatives *[TO DO]*
[] MAYBE the SAMPL9 WP6 host: https://github.com/samplchallenges/sampl9 *[TO DO]*

- `run.py` - script to run bespokefit on input molecule. Takes a SMILES string and ID. Creates a folder with results based on the input ID. Command: `python run.py -smiles 'BrCO' -id BrCO`
- `run_all.py` - Script to run `run.py` on a CSV containing multiple SMILES. Command: `python run_all.py -fragments_csv_file host-systems/fragments.csv`
- `How_to_train_your_forcefield.ipynb` - Notebook taken from OpenFF blogpost on how to use Bespokefit.
- `host-systems/` - Contains original host files and, fragments of the host, images of the fragments, and a `.csv` file that contains fragment ID's and SMILES strings.
- `OA-fragment-*/` - Bespokefit results for a specific host fragment.
